//     When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__') and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
//     It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed, and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.
//     Pretend you don't know the word, and call guessLetter multiple times with various letters to check that your program works.
