  # This mode file tells ActiveRecord where to find your
  # database table - it uses the pluralised lowercase
  # version of this class name, i.e. 'planets'

  # Later on, we will also specify and associations
  # here, such as 'has_many :astronauts' etc

  # Much later on, you can also define your own methods
  # here to specify business logic for this model
  #
  # "Fat models, skinny controllers"
